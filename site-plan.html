        [ABOUT ME
        Let me tell you about me! I am a native of Arizona, I grew up in Mesa. Im 26 years old.  I attended Westwood High School 2011-2015 graduating from High School and a Trade School called E.V.I.T(East Valley Institute of Technology) graduating with a certificate of completion in graphic design. In 2018 I attended Scottsdale Community College and graduated with my associate degree in graphic design in December of 2022. I am currently attending BYU-I and getting my bachelor’s in software development. Learning software development has helped me see how very similar it is to graphic design. I’m applying a lot of what I have already done into all the new things I get to learn. Seeing and learning It has helped me tremendously in life, work and much more. It has made me a more confident person and I’m more willing to try new things, think outside the box, and give my all to it.

        Time to get to the good stuff! This is where you will find all my work. Im so proud of each thing I got to create. All these things gave me great learning experience. I enjoyed making each of these, and I hope you will appreciate them as much as I do! Under each of these is a short description of that design; a little bit about how it was made, why I made it, and my overall feel of it. I know you’ll enjoy seeing what I can for you. I hope you’ll take all of what you have seen and read under consideration to let me work for you! I look forward to doing so! Have a great day!
