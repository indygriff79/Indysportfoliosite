    <h2>Magazine Cover</h2>
    <p>This is a magazine cover I had to create using photoshop. I edited the photo, getting rid of any blemishes, brightening the skin, came up with the title,sub title, the quotes in the red boxes, song names, all of it. I am super happy with how this turned out. I can honestly say it's one of favorite pieces I've done! </p>

    <h2>Planet Scape</h2>
   <p>This is a piece that I made using photoshop. I really enjoyed making all the details in this project. From the space dust, to the planet rings, it all was really fun to make. </p>

        <h2>Chinse Takeout Menu</h2>
    <p>This is a take-out menu I had to create for a project! It was probably one the most challenging projects I had to do because there was SO MUCH text! I am really proud of how it turned out and I am happy to share it with you! </p>

<section class="event-poster">
    <img class="event-poster-img" src="images/Griffitts_EventPoster.jpg" alt="'muse poster">
    <p>This is a event poster I had to make in photoshop as well, utilizing the clipping mask tool. This is a redo of a previous project from a different class that I decided to redo. I'm really happy with how this came out. Using the clipping mask is one of tools that is so useful in so many ways. I loved making this poster</p>

    <p>This wasn't a project for school. My grandpa passed away in April of 2022, and I asked if I could make his funeral program. It was an honor to do so, and I'm so glad I got to contribute this to him. Its a Z- fold program</p>

    <p>This is the full Ad had to re-create. I am really happy with how it all came together! The text (again) was definitely the trickiest part, but it worked out in the end. I'm proud of this Ad redo!</p>
